git remote add upstream https://github.com/Xenonesis/DocMagic.git
```

#### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/feature-name` for new features
- `fix/bug-description` for bug fixes

- Include a blank line before the body
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant
- Use bullet points for multiple changes

#### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
