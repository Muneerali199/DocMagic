## 🕒 Automated Dependency Updates

DocMagic leverages automated tools to keep its dependencies up-to-date, ensuring security, performance, and compatibility. This process is managed through **Dependabot** and **GitHub Actions**, providing a seamless workflow for maintaining the project’s ecosystem.

### 🛠️ Setup and Configuration

#### ✅ Dependabot Configuration
A `.github/dependabot.yml` file is included to enable and configure automatic dependency updates for **npm** and other package managers. This file:
- Schedules **weekly checks**
- Manages updates for **minor and patch versions**
- Ignores **major updates** for critical packages (e.g., `next`, `react`) to prevent breaking changes

#### ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow
The `.github/workflows/dependency_check.yml` workflow:
- Runs **dependency audits**, **security checks**, and **build tests**
- Triggers on a **weekly schedule** and for `push`/`pull_request` events on the `main` branch
- Includes a `dependabot-auto-merge` job to **automatically approve and merge** Dependabot PRs after successful validation

### 🚀 How to Use

#### 1. Enable Dependabot
The configuration is pre-set in the repository. Ensure the `.github/dependabot.yml` file is present and committed to your fork or branch.

#### 2. Test the Workflow
Run the `test-dependabot-config` workflow manually via GitHub Actions with the `create_test_pr` input set to `true` on a test branch (e.g., `test-bot`) to verify the update process. This simulates dependency updates and triggers CI checks.

#### 3. Monitor PRs
Dependabot will automatically create pull requests for outdated dependencies. Review these PRs — the CI workflow will validate them. **Approved PRs are automatically merged** if all checks pass.

#### 4. Validate Updates
The workflow includes **tests and builds** to ensure updated dependencies do not break functionality. This helps maintain a **stable and secure** application. Check the **GitHub Actions logs** for detailed output.

feature/your-feature-name
feature/ai-prompt-optimization

# Bug fix branches
fix/issue-description

git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

#### **Step 2: Create Feature Branch**

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature
```

#### **Step 3: Commit Your Changes**

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

## 📝 Coding Standards

Our coding standards ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across the entire codebase.

### 🎯 **TypeScript Guidelines**

- **Always use TypeScript** - No plain JavaScript files
- **Strict typing** - Avoid `any` type whenever possible
- **Interface over Type** - Prefer interfaces for object shapes

```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}

// ❌ Avoid
const user: any = { ... }
```

### 🎨 **Styling Guidelines**

- **Tailwind CSS only** - No custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
- **Mobile-first approach** - Start with mobile styles, scale up
- **Consistent spacing** - Use Tailwind's spacing scale

```tsx
// ✅ Good
<button className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 px-4 py-2 rounded-md transition-colors">
  Click me
</button>

// ❌ Avoid inline styles
<button style={{ backgroundColor: '#007bff', padding: '8px 16px' }}>
  Click me
</button>
```

### 🧩 **Component Guidelines**

- **Use Radix UI** for complex components
- **Implement accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Props interfaces** for all components

```tsx
// ✅ Good component structure
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant = "primary",
  children,
  onClick,
}) => {
  return (
    <button className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant }))} onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### ✅ **Code Quality Checks**

Before submitting any PR, ensure:

```bash
# Linting passes
npm run lint

# TypeScript compilation succeeds
npm run build

# Tests pass (when implemented)
npm run test
```
