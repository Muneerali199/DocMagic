# Enable shareable public URL for created PowerPoint presentations #73

**Version:** 0.8.0  
**Author:** Xenonesis  
**Release Date:** January 15, 2025

## Overview
This feature adds the ability to share created PowerPoint presentations via public URLs, allowing users to easily distribute their presentations to others without requiring them to have accounts or access to the platform.

## Problem Statement
**Current behavior:** No simple way to share a created PPT.

**Expected behavior:** "Share" button on the PPT completion page generates a link (e.g., https://doc-magic-heob.vercel.app/ppt/view/xyz123) that anyone can use to view the presentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] After creating a PPT, user sees a "Share" button
- [x] Clicking "Share" copies a unique URL for that PPT
- [x] Visiting the URL reliably shows (or downloads) the PPT
- [x] (Optional) Add visibility/privacy settings

## Implementation Details

### 🗄️ Database Changes
A new migration file has been created to enable public access to shared presentations:

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250628163825_add_public_presentation_access.sql`

### 🔧 How to Run the SQL Migration

#### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
npx supabase db push
```

#### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution
If you prefer to run the SQL manually in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Create a new query and paste the following SQL:

```sql
/*
  # Add public access policy for presentations

  1. Changes
    - Add policy to allow public read access to public presentations
    - This enables sharing functionality for presentations marked as public
*/

-- Allow public read access to public presentations
CREATE POLICY "Public can read public presentations"
  ON documents
  FOR SELECT
  TO anon, authenticated
  USING (
    type = 'presentation' 
    AND content->>'isPublic' = 'true'
  );
```

4. Click **Run** to execute the migration

#### Option 3: Using Supabase CLI with specific migration
```bash
# If you want to run just this specific migration
npx supabase db reset --linked
```

#### Access Control
- **Public presentations**: Accessible to `anon` and `authenticated` users

### 🎯 User Flow

1. **Create Presentation**: User generates a presentation using the existing flow
2. **Share Option**: "Share Presentation" button appears on completion
3. **Generate Link**: Click button to save presentation and generate shareable URL
4. **Copy to Clipboard**: URL is automatically copied for easy sharing
5. **Share with Others**: Recipients can view the presentation without accounts
6. **Privacy Control**: Owner can toggle between public/private at any time

### 🧪 Testing the Feature

#### Test Share Functionality
1. Create a new presentation
2. Complete the generation process
3. Click "Share Presentation" button
4. Verify URL is copied to clipboard
5. Open the generated URL in an incognito window
6. Confirm presentation displays correctly

#### Test Privacy Controls
1. Create and share a presentation (public)
2. Visit the share URL - should work
3. Toggle to private in the viewer
4. Visit the share URL in incognito - should show "private" message
5. Toggle back to public - should work again

### 🔧 Environment Variables
Make sure your environment has the correct base URL set:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://doc-magic-heob.vercel.app
```

### 📊 Database Schema Impact

The existing `documents` table is used with the following content structure for presentations:

```json
{
  "slides": [...],
  "template": "modern-business",
  "isPublic": true
}
```

No schema changes were required - only a new RLS policy was added.

## Deployment Notes

1. **Run the migration** before deploying the new code
2. **Verify RLS policies** are active in your Supabase project
3. **Test the share URLs** work in production environment
4. **Check environment variables** are properly set

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Verify the migration ran successfully
2. Check Supabase RLS policies are enabled
3. Ensure environment variables are set correctly
4. Test with both authenticated and anonymous users
