# 🔧 Fix: OpenAI API Key Not Configured

## ❌ The Error

```
Text parsing error: Error: OpenAI API key not configured
```

This happens when you try to create a resume from text input because the app needs OpenAI to parse and structure your text.

---

## ✅ Solution (2 Steps)

### **Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key**

1. **Go to:** https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Sign in** or create an account
3. **Click** "Create new secret key"
4. **Name it:** "DocMagic Resume Parser"
5. **Copy** the key (starts with `sk-...`)
6. **Save it** somewhere safe (you won't see it again!)

**Cost:** Very cheap! ~$0.001 per resume (less than 1 cent)

### **Step 2: Add API Key to .env File**

#### **Option A: Edit .env File Directly**

1. Open your project folder: `C:\Users\Muneer Ali Subzwari\Desktop\docmagic\DocMagic`
2. Find the `.env` file (might be hidden)
3. Open it in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
4. Find the line: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here`
5. Replace `your-openai-api-key-here` with your actual key
6. Save the file

**Example:**
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-abc123xyz456...
```

#### **Option B: Create .env File (if it doesn't exist)**

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Open `.env` in text editor
3. Add your OpenAI API key
4. Save

### **Step 3: Restart Your Development Server**

1. **Stop** the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Start** it again:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Try creating a resume** from text again

## 💡 Alternative: Use Gemini Instead

If you don't want to use OpenAI, you can modify the code to use Gemini (which you might already have configured):

**Pros:**
- Free tier available
- Already configured in your extension

**Cons:**
- Requires code changes
- OpenAI is more accurate for resume parsing

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

After adding the API key and restarting:

1. Go to your app: http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Create Resume"
3. Choose "Import from Text"
4. Paste some profile text
5. Click "Parse"
6. ✅ Should work without errors!

## 📊 Check Your .env File

Your `.env` file should have at least these:

```env
# Required for the app to work
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-key

# Required for AI features
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key-here

# Required for authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Invalid API key"
**Fix:** Make sure you copied the entire key (starts with `sk-`)

### Issue 2: "API key not found"
**Fix:** Make sure the `.env` file is in the root folder (same level as `package.json`)

### Issue 3: "Still getting the error"
**Fix:** 
1. Stop the server completely
2. Delete `.next` folder
3. Restart: `npm run dev`

### Issue 4: "Can't see .env file"
**Fix:** Enable "Show hidden files" in Windows Explorer:
- View → Show → Hidden items
