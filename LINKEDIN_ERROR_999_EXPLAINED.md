# 🛡️ LinkedIn Error 999 - Why URL Import Doesn't Work

## ❌ The Problem

When trying to import from LinkedIn URL, you see:
```
❌ Request failed with status code 999
```

## 🔍 What is Error 999?

**Error 999** is LinkedIn's **anti-bot protection**. It means:

- 🛡️ LinkedIn detected automated access
- 🤖 They block ALL scraping tools (not just ours)
- 🔒 They require login for detailed profile data
- ⚡ They actively prevent bot-like behavior

### **This affects EVERYONE**
- ❌ All automated tools get blocked
- ❌ RapidAPI service suspended
- ❌ MCP scraping blocked  
- ❌ AI scraping blocked
- ❌ Basic scraping blocked

LinkedIn doesn't want bots accessing their data.
