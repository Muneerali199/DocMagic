# 🔗 LinkedIn URL Import Setup Guide

## 🚀 Feature Overview

The LinkedIn URL Import feature uses **3 scraping methods** in order of reliability:

1. **RapidAPI LinkedIn Scraper** (Best quality, most reliable)
2. **AI-Powered Extraction** (Good quality, uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)
3. **Basic Web Scraping** (Limited data, no API keys needed)

The system tries each method automatically until one succeeds.

## 📋 Quick Setup (Choose One)

### ✨ **Option 1: RapidAPI (Recommended - Best Results)**

**Why?** Most reliable, complete data extraction, free tier available

**Steps:**

1. Go to [RapidAPI LinkedIn Data API](https://rapidapi.com/linkedin-data-api/api/linkedin-data-api)
2. Sign up / Login to RapidAPI
3. Subscribe to **FREE plan** (500 requests/month free!)
4. Copy your API key from dashboard
5. Add to `.env.local`:

```env
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
```

6. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

**Cost:** FREE (500 requests/month)

---

### 🤖 **Option 2: OpenAI (Good Alternative)**

**Why?** Already have OpenAI key? Uses AI to intelligently parse LinkedIn HTML

**Steps:**

1. Use your existing OpenAI API key OR get one at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Add to `.env.local`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

**Cost:** ~$0.001 per profile import (very cheap!)

---

### 🔨 **Option 3: Basic Scraping (No Setup)**

**Why?** Works immediately without any API keys

**Limitations:**
- Only extracts basic info (name, headline, location, summary)
- No work experience, education, or skills
- May be blocked by LinkedIn occasionally

**Steps:** Nothing! Just use it. The system falls back to this automatically.

## 🛠️ Environment Variables Reference

Add these to your `.env.local` file in project root:

```env
# LinkedIn URL Import (Choose at least one)

# Option 1: RapidAPI (Recommended - Best Results)
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here

# Option 2: OpenAI (Good Alternative)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# Note: If both are set, RapidAPI is tried first (more reliable)
# If neither is set, basic scraping is used (limited data)
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test with RapidAPI:
```bash
# Make sure RAPIDAPI_KEY is in .env.local
npm run dev
# Go to http://localhost:3000/resume
# Click "LinkedIn Import" tab
# Enter: https://linkedin.com/in/williamhgates
# Should see: "✅ Profile imported successfully! Used RapidAPI to extract..."
```

### Test with OpenAI:
```bash
# Remove RAPIDAPI_KEY temporarily, keep OPENAI_API_KEY
npm run dev
# Same test as above
# Should see: "✅ Profile imported successfully! Used AI-Powered Extraction to extract..."
```

### Test Basic Scraping:
```bash
# Remove both API keys temporarily
npm run dev
# Same test as above
# Should see: "✅ Profile imported successfully! Used Basic Web Scraping to extract..."
# Note: Will show limited data warning
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Failed to import LinkedIn profile"

**Error**: All scraping methods failed

**Solutions**:
1. Check if `.env.local` exists in project root
2. Verify API keys are correct (no extra spaces)
3. Restart dev server after adding keys
4. Check console for detailed error messages
5. Try alternative methods (PDF Export or Manual Entry)

### ⚠️ "Limited data extracted"

**Issue**: Only name and headline imported

**Why**: Basic scraping can't access full LinkedIn profiles without login

**Solution**: 
- Set up RapidAPI or OpenAI keys (see above)
- OR use PDF Export method (100% reliable)

### 🔐 "LinkedIn may be blocking automated access"

**Issue**: LinkedIn detected scraping

**Solution**:
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Use RapidAPI (bypasses LinkedIn blocks)
- Use PDF Export method (always works)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Use PDF Export for Complete Data**
Even with API keys, PDF Export is often the most reliable method:
- Go to LinkedIn → More → Save to PDF
- Upload PDF in DocMagic
- 100% success rate, full data extraction

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
If using RapidAPI free tier:
- 500 requests/month = ~16 per day
- Perfect for personal use
- Upgrade if needed for high volume

### 3. **Privacy & Security**
- API keys are stored server-side only (`.env.local`)
- Never exposed to client browser
- LinkedIn profile URLs are public data
- No LinkedIn login credentials needed

### 4. **Fallback Strategy**
System automatically tries methods in this order:
1. RapidAPI → 2. OpenAI → 3. Basic → 4. Show alternatives

You can rely on it to use the best available method!
