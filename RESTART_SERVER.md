# 🔧 Fix Applied - Restart Required

## ✅ What I Fixed

I added the correct environment variable to your `.env` file:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAzwsBnJ77sgM5dXAH6eaMOxfT9UT0QK4E
```

**Issue:** Your `.env` had `GOOGLE_API_KEY` but the code needs `GEMINI_API_KEY`

## 🚀 Next Step: Restart Your Server

### **IMPORTANT: You MUST restart for this to work!**

1. **Stop the current server:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal
   - Wait for it to fully stop

2. **Start the server again:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Wait for it to compile**
   - Should say "Ready in X seconds"
   - Look for: `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Test it:**
   - Go to your app
   - Try creating a resume from text
   - Should work now! ✅

## 🔍 Why This Happened

**Your `.env` file had:**
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyAzwsBnJ77sgM5dXAH6eaMOxfT9UT0QK4E  ❌
```

**But the code needs:**
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAzwsBnJ77sgM5dXAH6eaMOxfT9UT0QK4E  ✅
```

The variable name must match exactly what the code expects!

---

## ✅ Verification

After restarting, you should see in the console:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
Ready in X seconds
```

Then when you create a resume:
```
Using Gemini AI for text parsing...
✅ Profile extracted successfully
```

**No more errors!** 🎉

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

### **Option 1: Delete .next folder**
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### **Option 2: Check .env file**
Make sure it has this line:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAzwsBnJ77sgM5dXAH6eaMOxfT9UT0QK4E
```

### **Option 3: Verify in terminal**
After starting server, check if it loaded:
```bash
# In Node.js console
console.log(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY)
# Should show: AIzaSyAzwsBnJ77sgM5dXAH6eaMOxfT9UT0QK4E
```
