# URL to Presentation Feature - Implementation Guide

## ✅ What's Been Created

I've successfully implemented a new feature that allows users to create presentations from any website URL. Here's what was built:

### 1. **API Endpoint** - `/api/fetch-url-content/route.ts`
- Fetches content from any HTTP/HTTPS URL
- Uses Cheerio to parse HTML and extract text
- Extracts title, description, headings, and main content
- Handles errors gracefully (timeouts, invalid URLs, etc.)
- Limits content to 8000 characters to avoid token limits

### 2. **UI Component** - `components/presentation/url-input-section.tsx`
- Reusable component with tabs for "Text Input" and "From URL"
- URL input field with validation
- "Extract Content from URL" button
- Loading states during content extraction
- Success indicator showing word count
- Fully styled with your existing design system

## 🔧 How to Integrate

You need to make a small change to `components/presentation/presentation-generator.tsx`:

### Step 1: Import the new component

At the top of the file, add:
```typescript
import { UrlInputSection } from "@/components/presentation/url-input-section";
```

### Step 2: Replace the text input section

Find this section (around line 1008-1021):
```tsx
<div className="space-y-2">
  <Label htmlFor="prompt" className="text-sm font-medium flex items-center gap-2">
    <Sparkles className="h-4 w-4 text-yellow-500" />
    Describe your presentation
  </Label>
  <Textarea
    id="prompt"
    placeholder="E.g., Create a startup pitch deck..."
    className="min-h-[140px] text-base glass-effect..."
    value={prompt}
    onChange={(e) => setPrompt(e.target.value)}
    disabled={isGenerating}
  />
</div>
```

Replace it with:
```tsx
<UrlInputSection
  prompt={prompt}
  setPrompt={setPrompt}
  isGenerating={isGenerating}
/>
```

That's it! The feature is now fully integrated.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User enters a URL** in the "From URL" tab
2. **Clicks "Extract Content"** button
3. **Backend fetches** the webpage and extracts text using Cheerio
4. **Content is processed** and formatted as a presentation prompt
5. **User clicks "Generate AI Structure"** to create the presentation
6. **AI analyzes** the extracted content and creates slides

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ **Smart Content Extraction**: Automatically finds main content areas
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid URLs, timeouts, etc.
- ✅ **Loading States**: Visual feedback during extraction
- ✅ **Word Count Display**: Shows how much content was extracted
- ✅ **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing presentation generation flow
- ✅ **Beautiful UI**: Matches your existing Canva-style design

## 📝 Example Usage

1. Go to Presentation section
2. Click "From URL" tab
3. Enter: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence`
4. Click "Extract Content from URL"
5. Wait for success message
6. Click "Generate AI Structure"
7. Choose a template
8. Generate your presentation!

## 🔒 Security Features

- URL validation (only HTTP/HTTPS)
- 10-second timeout to prevent hanging
- Content length limits
- Removes scripts, styles, and non-content elements
- Sanitizes extracted text

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

The feature is fully implemented and ready to use. Just make the small integration change in `presentation-generator.tsx` and you're good to go!
