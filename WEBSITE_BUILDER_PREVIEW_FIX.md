# 🔧 Website Builder Preview - Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The preview functionality has been enhanced with better error handling and automatic updates.

## 🛠️ Changes Made

### 1. **Added useEffect Hook**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (websiteCode && iframeRef.current) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      updatePreview(websiteCode);
    }, 100);
  }
}, [websiteCode]);
```
- Automatically updates preview when code is generated
- Small delay ensures iframe is mounted
- Triggers on websiteCode state change

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
```typescript
// Validate response
if (!data.html || !data.css) {
  throw new Error('Invalid response: missing HTML or CSS');
}
```
- Checks for required fields
- Provides clear error messages
- Prevents broken previews

### 3. **Added Console Logging**
```typescript
console.log('Generated website data:', data);
console.log('updatePreview called with code:', code);
console.log('Preview updated successfully');
```
- Helps debug issues
- Shows what data is received
- Confirms preview updates

### 4. **Fallback Content**
```typescript
${code.html || '<p>No HTML content</p>'}
${code.css || ''}
${code.javascript || ''}
```
- Prevents errors if fields are missing
- Shows fallback message
- Graceful degradation

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Website Builder
```
http://localhost:3000/website-builder
```

### Step 3: Generate a Website
```
1. Enter prompt: "Create a modern landing page"
2. Choose style: "Modern"
3. Click "Generate Website with AI"
4. Wait 5-10 seconds
```

### Step 4: Check Preview
```
1. After generation, you should see the preview automatically
2. Try switching between Desktop/Tablet/Mobile views
3. Check browser console (F12) for any errors
```

## 🐛 Debugging

### If Preview Still Doesn't Show:

1. **Check Browser Console (F12)**
   ```
   Look for:
   - "Generated website data:" - Shows API response
   - "updatePreview called with code:" - Confirms function runs
   - "Preview updated successfully" - Confirms iframe update
   ```

2. **Check API Response**
   ```
   - Should have: html, css, javascript fields
   - Should not have errors
   - Check Network tab for /api/generate/website
   ```

3. **Check Iframe**
   ```
   - Inspect the iframe element
   - Check if it has content
   - Look for sandbox restrictions
   ```

4. **Common Issues:**
   - **CORS errors**: Check browser console
   - **Sandbox restrictions**: Iframe has `sandbox="allow-scripts"`
   - **Missing API key**: Check GOOGLE_API_KEY env variable
   - **AI generation fails**: Falls back to template

## 📊 What to Expect

### Successful Generation:
```
1. Toast: "🎉 Website Generated!"
2. Console: "Generated website data: {...}"
3. Console: "updatePreview called with code: {...}"
4. Console: "Preview updated successfully"
5. Preview shows in iframe
```

### If It Fails:
```
1. Toast: "Error: Failed to generate website"
2. Console: Error messages
3. Check API response in Network tab
4. Verify GOOGLE_API_KEY is set
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

1. **After clicking "Generate":**
   - Button shows loading spinner
   - "Generating Your Website..." text
   - Takes 5-10 seconds

2. **After generation:**
   - Success toast appears
   - Preview section becomes visible
   - Iframe shows generated website
   - Can switch viewport sizes

3. **Preview features:**
   - Desktop view (100% width)
   - Tablet view (768px width)
   - Mobile view (375px width)
   - Fully interactive
   - JavaScript works
