## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- Uses existing `auth.users` metadata for profile information
- Queries `templates` and `documents` tables for real statistics
- No additional database tables required

### Storage Setup
```sql
-- Create avatars bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true);

-- RLS policies for secure access
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

### File Structure
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Main profile page component
- `scripts/setup-storage.sql` - Storage bucket setup
- `scripts/supabase-setup.sql` - Updated with storage configuration
