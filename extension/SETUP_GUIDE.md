# 🚀 DocMagic Extension - Quick Setup Guide

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The **"Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"** error has been resolved!

### What Was Wrong?
- The extension was trying to connect to `http://localhost:3000/api` (a backend server that doesn't exist)
- The extension needed a running backend API server to work

### What's Fixed Now?
- ✅ **No backend needed!** Extension uses Google Gemini AI directly
- ✅ **Smart auto-detection** of coding problems on LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
- ✅ **Automatic page crawling** to understand what problem you're solving
- ✅ **Context-aware AI assistance** with hints, solutions, and explanations
