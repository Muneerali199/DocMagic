4. *Forgetting Version Control*: Mention Git and branching strategies in teams

## ATS Optimization

- Use consistent section titles: “Experience,” “Education,” “Skills,” etc.
- Include Java-related keywords like: “Spring Boot,” “REST API,” “JPA,” “Microservices,” “Jenkins,” “JUnit,” “Docker”
- Avoid images, charts, or columns—use clean text formatting
- Save as PDF and test in resume scanners (e.g., Jobscan or ResumeWorded)
